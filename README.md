# Spotifier 
Spotifier is a web application that notifies the user via email when a specific track is released on Spotify. 
First, the user creates a sort of watchlist of yet unreleased songs. Then Spotifier queries the Spotify API in set intervalls for the songs in the list and sends out an email to the user, once the API returns positive results.

The app is still in development but is planned to be released to the public in late 2018.
